output: /bin/demo
# Need to monitor the additional file name suffix, the default only '.go' file

    - .yml
# need to monitor the directory, the default only the current directory
watch_paths:
    - ../pk
# when the program is executed, additional parameters need to be added
cmd_args:
    - arg1=val1
# need to increase the additional environment variables, the default has been loaded by the current environment variables
envs:
    - a=b
# whether to monitor the 'vendor' folder under the file changes
vendor_watch: false
# do not need to listen to the directory
excluded_paths:
    - path
